## Article Design
 
In this phase, you can use Moldflow Insight 2012 to evaluate the manufacturability of your part design. You can perform various analyses, such as:
 
- Fill analysis: to predict the filling behavior of the melt, identify potential defects, such as short shots, weld lines, air traps, and sink marks, and optimize the gate location, size, and shape.
- Pack analysis: to simulate the packing pressure and time, evaluate the volumetric shrinkage and residual stresses, and optimize the packing profile.
- Cool analysis: to simulate the cooling system performance, analyze the temperature distribution and heat transfer coefficient, and optimize the cooling channel layout, size, and flow rate.
- Warp analysis: to predict the part deformation due to differential shrinkage and residual stresses, and evaluate the impact of process parameters, material properties, and geometry on warpage.

To perform these analyses, you need to create a mesh model of your part geometry using the Meshing tools in Moldflow Insight 2012. You can import your CAD model in various formats, such as IGES, STEP, Parasolid, or STL. You can also use the Fusion 360 push feature to quickly update your geometry changes from Fusion 360 to Moldflow Insight 2012. You can then apply material data from the extensive Moldflow material database or create your own custom material. You can also define process settings, such as injection pressure, temperature, time, and speed. You can then run the simulation using local, remote, or cloud servers. You can view the results using various visualization tools, such as contour plots, vector plots, graphs, animations, or reports. You can also share your results with other stakeholders using Autodesk Drive or Shared Views.
 
## Tool Design and Construction
 
In this phase, you can use Moldflow Insight 2012 to validate and optimize your mold design and construction. You can perform various analyses, such as:

- Runner analysis: to simulate the flow behavior of the melt in the runner system, analyze the pressure drop and shear rate along the runner path, and optimize the runner layout, size, shape, and balance.
- Gate analysis: to simulate the flow behavior of the melt at the gate area, analyze the gate freeze time and pressure loss at the gate opening, and optimize the gate type (such as edge gate or fan gate), location (such as center gate or side gate), size (such as diameter or width), shape (such as round or rectangular), and angle (such as perpendicular or parallel).
- Vent analysis: to simulate the air evacuation during filling and packing phases,
analyze the vent size and location required to prevent air traps and burn marks,
and optimize the vent design (such as slot vent or pin vent) and placement (such as near weld lines or end of flow).
- Cooling analysis: to simulate the cooling system performance in detail,
analyze the temperature distribution and heat transfer coefficient in the mold,
and optimize the cooling channel layout (such as straight or spiral), size (such as diameter or cross-section), shape (such as round or square), flow rate (such as laminar or turbulent), direction (such as parallel or counter-flow), material (such as steel or copper), and type (such as conventional or conformal).

To perform these analyses, you need to create a mesh model of your mold geometry using the Meshing tools in Moldflow Insight 2012. You can import your CAD model in various formats, such as IGES, STEP, Parasolid, or STL.
